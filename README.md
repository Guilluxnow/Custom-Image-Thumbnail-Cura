# Custom-Image-Thumbnail-Cura
A script to manage your thumbnail image in Cura


As a big user of Hueforge, I wasn't satisfied of the thumbnails generated in Cura because it was hard to see the image I was going to print. 
So i managed to do a script that allows me to have any image I want as a thumbnail.

I've only tested it on Moonraker with my printer on klipper.

This script works on ufp generated files not on "normal" gcode.

To use it simply paste the code in the scripts folder of your cura "C:\Users\"YOUR USER NAME"\AppData\Roaming\cura\5.10\scripts", restart your cura if it was open.
Th script should appear inside Extensions->Post Processing->Modify G-Code

Here its how it looks like on my touch screen
